# More about ACS:
This readme file will provide you with a summary of the background research I carried out. 
## Problem:
From the background research I have carried out on Digital Transformation, I have found out that many organisations have already initiated the digital transformation process. The main reason I discovered behind this, is an increase in operational efficiency which results in bigger profit and, most importantly, saves operational costs.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic, even healthcare industries have taken initiative to transform their hospitals digitally and also have fast-tracked this process. However, digital transformation of a hospital will increase the attack surface by introducing new threats and vulnerabilities. Rather than increasing the operational efficiency of the hospital, the newly introduced threats and vulnerabilities will put one of the key stakeholders at risk i.e. patients. 

Deploying countermeasures & safeguards is a great option to mitigate the threats & vulnerabilities. However, putting controls on technology can hinder its performance. For example: technology like  IoT devices have lower processing power and placing security control can impact the performance of the device.

*** If the service after its digitalization has the same or worse performance in comparison with the service prior to digitalization, then should it be digitalized? *** 

## Goal: 
The goal of this project is to help hospitals with determining whether a service should be digitalized or not.

## Project Constraints: 
Hospitals contain many departments and each department can offer many services to patients. As this was the Final Year Project, exploring all services offered by departments by myself was not feasible due to deadlines and resources. 
Therefore, I reduced the  scope of the investigation and decided that I would focus on one of the services offered by the hospital’s department.

## Reducing Scope and Selecting Service:
After carrying out more background research, I identified that since 2013, NHS-UK has been failing to achieve the target, that 95% of A&E patients should be seen within the four hours of their arrival _(Summary Reports - Performance Times and Waits for Admissions - NHS Digital, 2022.)_
Therefore, I decided that I will explore the Booking and Triaging service of A&E departments.

## Re-defined Goal: 
*** Whether digitalized booking and triaging performs better than “as-is” service in the A&E department? ***

## Solution:
I decided that I will be carrying out a Simulation study to explore the Booking and Triaging service offered by the A&E department. This is because simulations can be built over the computer using open-source and free technologies. Moreover, the model built does not need to exactly represent the service, meaning it does not need to model all the components and all their interactions but model the ones required for the investigation. Thus, simulation study caters for the project constraints.
