# ACS
Artificial Cyber Seer (ACS) is my final year (2021-2022) software project, where I created simulation model to determine whether Accident & Emergency Department's booking & triaging service should get digitalised or not. If you are interested in reading more about the project please see [README file in Design Folder](/Design/README.MD)

If you are interested in running the project onto your local machine, please see the [README file in ACS folder](/ACS/README.MD)

## ACS's Project worflow:
1. Carrying background research to identify problem, project goal & explore potential solutions. 
2. Selecting suitable SDLC for the project. 
3. Creating a plan for the project. 
4. Executing plan and building a software solution. 
5. Presenting ACS to supervisors and incorporating their feedback.

## Software Development Lifecycle used:  
- Solo SCRUM
- Whilst exploring simulation study as a potential solution, I learnt that, the simulation study is iterative in nature. This is because in simulation study, at first a conceptual model is built, then its tested and revised, before it is translated into computerised model. In-order to cater for this feature of simulation study, I decided to develop my project using an agile methodology than using rigid one like waterfall.

## Personal Development Outcome:
- Acquired the ability to carry out in-dept research.
- Acquired ability to simultaneously learn, attain and apply the knowledge by learning how to carry out simulation study. 
- Learnt technologies like: Python, Flask and SimPy, and React JS.
